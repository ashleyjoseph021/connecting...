“Computer programming is an art because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they do and will do it better.” – Donald Knuth

    <p> I have spent the last 3 months researching and writing about computational sustainability. Why have I been doing this? I am currently in Dr. Kristen Brown's ENGL 2010 class. This class is centered around a researched 8-10 argumentative esssay and presenting what we have learned. Why have I put so much effort into this? At first I was very much overwhlemed, but slowly I started enjoying researching and writing about my topic. This website is going to house everything I have learned. </p>

    <br>

    <p> What is my Topic? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px"> Computational Sustainabilty </p>

    <br>

    <p> Why computational sustainability? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px"> I chose computational sustainability as my topic because it relates to my major. I am currenly a computer science major. When I was first thinking about what I wanted my topic to be I had a couple inital ideas, but none were really sitcking. I decided to see if there was any area of environmental stewarship that had to do with computer science and that's how I found out about computational sustainability. The more I read into computational sustanability the more I knew that this was what my topic should be. It invloved something I am passionate about so it was the perfect topic for me. </p>
